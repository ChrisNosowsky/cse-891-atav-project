Project Approaches to the DNN:

1. CNN + LSTM
Capture screen data, throttle and steering inputs and then use that as the ground truth for training. Then for testing, the process will involve the same process.

2. Reinforcement learning

3. Using sensor data for training and predicting next steering/throttle input




## Notes
Best AI to train per track
